                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Désirée Bellan, a recently graduated Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Engineer with a passion for developing innovative solutions to complex problems. My areas of expertise include machine learning, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and generative AI.</p>
                <p>I am proficient in several programming languages such as Python, C++, C, Java, and JavaScript. My experience spans various multi-platform projects, where I have honed my skills in database management (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and deployment tools (Kubernetes, Docker, Flask).</p>
                <p>During my master's program, I actively contributed to projects utilizing machine learning frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, TensorBoard, Keras, scikit-learn, and Caffe. I also have experience with data preprocessing and analysis using Pandas and SciPy, and I am well-versed in NLP libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, Gensim, and Hugging Face.</p>
                <p>I have a strong understanding of cloud platforms, including AWS SageMaker and Microsoft Azure, and MLOps platforms like MLflow. I am also experienced with CI/CD tools such as Jenkins and GitHub Actions.</p>
                <p>In addition to my technical skills, I possess strong soft skills in presentation, planning, organization, creative problem-solving, teamwork, active listening, adaptability, and analytical thinking.</p>
                <p>I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional setting and am enthusiastically seeking opportunities to gain valuable experience and make meaningful contributions in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics.</p>
